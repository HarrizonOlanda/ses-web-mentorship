# Harrizon's day one in web learning
## Ses web mentorship Program
i have always been curios about how web applications are created and so i've always wanted
to learn how to code besides my busy school work.

This semester my classmate told me there's Ses web Development training and so i was excited to be part of it.
My day one was so exciting.I did't have a chance to attend the first physical class,and so i attended the second one which was online.
it was about how the internet works.
The programme focuses on;
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
